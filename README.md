# Python-AI
 This is a voice-controlled AI assistant using Python, voice recognition, and command parsing
 Web navigation, Wikipedia and WolframAlpha queries, and note recording.
 Main methods and helper methods were constructed to respond to commands instructed by the user's voice 
 Pyaudio files were separated and included so that the program could advance.
 WolframAlpha API was accessed to create a response query  to user input.
 Wikipedia. search method was used to identify the page based on user input and then was summarized by the computer voice.
In the future, I would like to further this project where the user can be identified by their voice and
the program will save it to a database. That way when the user talks, the computer will reply accordingly using proper identification.
